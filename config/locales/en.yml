    title: "About DMPonline"
    body_text_html: "<div class='white_background'>
    <p>Funding bodies increasingly require their grant-holders to produce Data Management Plans(DMP), both during the bid-preparation stage and after funding has been secured. DMPonline has been produced by the UK's Digital Curation Centre to help research teams respond to this requirement, and any expectations that their institution or others may apply.</p>
    <p>The <a href='http://www.dcc.ac.uk/' target='_blank'>DCC</a> has worked closely with research funders and universities to produce a tool that assists researchers to produce an effective data management plan (DMP) to cater for the whole lifecycle of a project, from bid-preparation stage through to completion.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>How the tool works</h3>
    <div class='white_background'>
    <p>There are a number of templates within the tool that represent the requirements of different funders and institutions. Users are asked three questions at the outset so we can determine the appropriate template to display (e.g. the ESRC template when applying for an ESRC grant). Guidance is provided to help you interpret and answer the questions. This guidance is provided by researcher funders, universities and disciplines.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <div class='white_background'>
    <p>If you have an account please sign in and start creating or editing your DMP.</p>
    <p>If you do not have a DMPonline account, click on <a href='/'>'Sign up'</a> on the homepage.</p>
    <p>Please visit the <a href='/help'>'Help'</a> page for guidance.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Additional Information</h3>
    <div class='white_background'>
    <p>We are constantly improving the user interface and functionality of DMPonline.
