    <p>Researchers will be guided through best practices in data stewardship. </p>
    <ul class='list'>
    <li class='list'>The tool walks researchers step-by-step through a number of key questions about data management.
    <li class='list'>Guidance and examples are provided.  
    <li class='list'>Not all questions will apply to all research projects. Researchers are encouraged to answer the questions relevant to their work.
    <li class='list'>Researchers should revisit the tool throughout their research to review or complete their responses.
